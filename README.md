This library represents me playing around with thrift, protobuffs, or grpc.
GRPC is almost the same as thrift. Protobuffers has a subset of these functionality
and just has methods to serialize structs, but does not provide actual implementation of servers or clients.
The advantage is that these tools are more efficient than other serialization libraries and also generate code in any language, thus allowing easy communication between languages.
